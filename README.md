# Project-Milestone-1

This milestone will explain the overall vision, goals, and key features of the e-commerce application.

# E-Commerce Application - Milestone 1

### 📖 Overview

Welcome to the E-Commerce Application built using the powerful MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)! This is the first milestone of an exciting journey where we will build a fully functional e-commerce app from scratch. In this milestone, we’ve laid the foundation for the application, establishing the overall structure and setting the stage for the next steps.

### 🌟 Features of the Application

User Authentication:
Secure registration and login system.

### Product Management:

Add, update, and retrieve product details.

### Order Handling:

Seamlessly manage customer orders.

### REST API Integration:

Well-structured endpoints for interaction.

### Database Schema Design:

Efficient schema structure in MongoDB.

### Authentication & Authorization:

Role-based access for secure transactions.

# 🛠️ Core Concepts Covered

## Overview of the MERN Stack

The MERN stack is a widely used set of technologies for developing full-stack web applications:

### MongoDB:

NoSQL database for flexible schema design.

### Express.js:

Lightweight backend framework for building REST APIs.

### React.js:

Frontend library for building user interfaces.

### Node.js:

Runtime for executing JavaScript on the server side. The MERN stack enables a JavaScript-only approach, streamlining development and making it easier to maintain both the frontend and backend using a single language.

# REST API Structure and Endpoints

The project includes a REST API to handle the following tasks:

## User Authentication

### POST /api/auth/register:

Register a new user.

### POST /api/auth/login:

Authenticate an existing user.

# Product Management

### GET /api/products:

Retrieve a list of all products.

### POST /api/products:

Add a new product.

### PUT /api/products/:id:

Update a product by ID.

### DELETE /api/products/:id:

Remove a product by ID.

# Order Handling

### GET /api/orders:

Retrieve all orders.

### POST /api/orders:

Create a new order.

### GET /api/orders/:id:

Retrieve order details by ID.

### Each API endpoint interacts with the MongoDB database and serves structured data in JSON format.

# Basics of Database Schema Design

MongoDB uses a flexible document-based schema. In this project:

### User Schema:

Stores user details (e.g., name, email, password, role).

### Product Schema:

Contains product details (e.g., name, price, description, stock).

### Order Schema:

Tracks orders, including user info, product details, and order status. The schemas are designed to ensure scalability and data integrity.

## Role of Authentication in Web Applications

### Authentication is vital for securing web applications. In this project:

### Users must authenticate to access sensitive features (e.g., placing orders).

### JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used to handle authentication securely.

### Role-based access ensures that only authorized users can perform specific actions (e.g., admin users managing products).
