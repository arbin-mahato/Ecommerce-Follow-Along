# Project-Milestone-1
This milestone will explain the overall vision, goals, and key features of the e-commerce application.

# E-Commerce Application - Milestone 1

### üìñ Overview
Welcome to the E-Commerce Application built using the powerful MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)! This is the first milestone of an exciting journey where we will build a fully functional e-commerce app from scratch. In this milestone, we‚Äôve laid the foundation for the application, establishing the overall structure and setting the stage for the next steps.

### üåü Features of the Application
User Authentication:
Secure registration and login system.

### Product Management:
Add, update, and retrieve product details.

### Order Handling:
Seamlessly manage customer orders.

### REST API Integration:
Well-structured endpoints for interaction.

### Database Schema Design:
Efficient schema structure in MongoDB.

### Authentication & Authorization:
Role-based access for secure transactions.

# üõ†Ô∏è Core Concepts Covered
## Overview of the MERN Stack
The MERN stack is a widely used set of technologies for developing full-stack web applications:

### MongoDB:
NoSQL database for flexible schema design.

### Express.js:
Lightweight backend framework for building REST APIs.

### React.js:
Frontend library for building user interfaces.

### Node.js:
Runtime for executing JavaScript on the server side. The MERN stack enables a JavaScript-only approach, streamlining development and making it easier to maintain both the frontend and backend using a single language.

# REST API Structure and Endpoints
The project includes a REST API to handle the following tasks:
## User Authentication
### POST /api/auth/register:
Register a new user.

### POST /api/auth/login:
Authenticate an existing user.

# Product Management
### GET /api/products:
Retrieve a list of all products.

### POST /api/products:
Add a new product.

### PUT /api/products/:id:
Update a product by ID.

### DELETE /api/products/:id:
Remove a product by ID.

# Order Handling
### GET /api/orders:
Retrieve all orders.

### POST /api/orders:
Create a new order.

### GET /api/orders/:id:
Retrieve order details by ID.

### Each API endpoint interacts with the MongoDB database and serves structured data in JSON format.
# Basics of Database Schema Design
MongoDB uses a flexible document-based schema. In this project:
### User Schema:
Stores user details (e.g., name, email, password, role).

### Product Schema:
Contains product details (e.g., name, price, description, stock).

### Order Schema:
Tracks orders, including user info, product details, and order status. The schemas are designed to ensure scalability and data integrity.

## Role of Authentication in Web Applications
###  Authentication is vital for securing web applications. In this project:
###  Users must authenticate to access sensitive features (e.g., placing orders).
### JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used to handle authentication securely.
### Role-based access ensures that only authorized users can perform specific actions (e.g., admin users managing products).
